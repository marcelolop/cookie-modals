# Cookies and modals

This project is a demonstration of how to create cookies and modals in JavaScript. The project is a simple website with a modal that pops up when the user visits the site.  When the user closes the modal by accepting or rejecting the cookies, a cookie is created that prevents the modal from popping up again for 20 seconds, that is the duration of the cookie.  The modal will pop up again after the cookie has expired.
